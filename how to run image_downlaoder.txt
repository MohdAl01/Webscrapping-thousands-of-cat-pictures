I copied that code from
https://betterprogramming.pub/building-an-imagedownloader-with-multiprocessing-in-python-44aee36e0424

The script runs in the command line. To use: open cmd in the directory with image_downloader.py and the text files. Then type:

py image_downloader.py *name of text file.txt*
